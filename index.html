        <p>My name is Christian Gividen, and I'm going into Computer Science.</p>
        <p>I love to bike, read, play videogames, and play tennis.</p>
        <p>I am currently single, and hopefully not the only one. I hope to be married someday and start a family.</p>
        <p>I was born into the church, and baptized when I was 8.</p>
        <p>This is a test</p>
        <p>I was born in Provo, Utah and raised there untill I was about 11. We moved to Corvallis Montana and have lived there since.</p>

        <p class="first-paragraph-home">Not a whole lot to say about these. I replaced the original buttons with new buttons. The buttons themselves feel kinda rubbery, but not too bad (in my biassed opinion). I also replaced the joycons' joysticks, so there shouldn't be any drifting for a couple more years depending on how much you use them.</p>

        <img class="middle-home-img" src="fixed_stuff/IMG_3796.jpg" alt="Stuff I sell">
        <p class="second-paragraph-home">The title says it all; this is an Xbox 1S controller that was rebuilt. What does that mean? It was destroyed. The plastic housing and joysticks were damaged beyond repair. So I bought a new shell replacement kit and some new joysticks, and it works almost as good as new. HOWEVER, the new sticks are too sensitive, and don't seem to be tuned for Xbox controllers. I've tried a few ways to tweak this, but to no avail. Still works, just overly sensitive. However, I might be willing to sell this controller at a later date.</p>

        <img class="bottom-home-img" src="fixed_stuff/IMG_3962.jpg" alt="Stuff I sell">
        <p class="third-paragraph-home">This controller was an interesting find. I replaced the plastic sticks and the joysticks. It worked until I plugged the battery back in WHILE the controller was still plugged into my PC... The orange light flashes a few times while charging before shutting off completely. I believe I shorted the main chip, though I'm not entirely sure. I don't have the equipment to test/fix this issue, so I will be selling this at some point for a very cheap price.</p>

        <img class="top-right-home-img" src="fixed_stuff/red_joycon.jpg" alt="Stuff I sell">
        <p class="fourth-paragraph-home">These joy-cons are the first pair I ever owned, and have been with me for about 5 years. I've treated them well, and have replaced the joysticks twice. Works great still to this day.</p>

        <img class="middle-right-home-img" src="fixed_stuff/joycon_purple_and_orange.jpg" alt="Stuff I sell">
        <p class="fifth-paragraph-home">These are the second pair of joycons I have (first and only pair purchased separately). They work great, and I've had them for about 3 years now. I replaced the buttons for fun, but will be switching them back to the factory buttons. The current buttons are starting to wear down and fade. The joysticks were replaced once.</p>

        <img class="bottom-right-home-img" src="fixed_stuff/ps5_controller.jpg" alt="Stuff I sell">
        <p class="sixth-paragraph-home">This PS5 controller was drifting, and all the buttons didn't work. I cleaned the inside and replaced the joysticks/potentiometers, and the controllers work well for the most part. I was able to fix the face and bumper buttons, but was (and still currently) unable to fix the triggers. Both triggers are always slightly active. On top of that, both triggers are activate the other and I can't figure out why.</p>

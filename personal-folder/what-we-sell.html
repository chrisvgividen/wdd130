    <p id="intro">You might be asking yourself "what are your limitations when fixing electronics?" Glad you asked! Sadly, I'm currently lacking the funds and skills to fix most electronics. However, I plan to continue learning new skills and techniques. So stay tuned! Soon, I might be able to repair phones, tablets, you name it!</p>

        <h2 class="title1">Controllers</h2>
        <img class="top-img" src="morepictures/controllers.jpg" alt="What we sell">
        <p class="first-paragraph">As you probably saw from the home page, I consider controllers to be vastly easier to repair compared to other electronics. All you need to fix a controller are some screwdrivers, spare parts, a soldering gun/iron (if fixing anything on the motherboard), and some patience. If you are ever in need of a controller or hobby, be sure to check back here or on my ebay store for a plethera of controllers. From broken to lightly used, and from nonfunctional to functional. I plan on selling all sorts of stuff here, so I hope you find something of value here!</p>

        <img class="middle-img" src="morepictures/nintendo_switch.jpg" alt="What we sell">
        <p class="second-paragraph">I'll be honest, I don't have a ton of knowledge when it comes to working on consoles. But that doesn't mean I won't try. Thus far, I've fixed my (old) nintendo switch and the power cord to the family Wii U. My switch was overheating, and the fan would be on full blast (I'll continue soon)</p>
